Last week, I created a Shiny app as a part of an assignment in Communicating with Data course.
In order to meet the requirement of the assignment, the app needs to give users a degree of freedom
to explore data related to COVID-19. [USA COVID-19 Explorer](https://github.com/etc5523-2020/shiny-assessment-j-effendy), the Shiny app that I created, allows users
to gain insights about the spread of COVID-19 in the US. It provides users with a number of interactive 
graphs and table where users can control what variable of interests to be displayed.

# Self Review

### What Went Well

The app separates its contents to three pages - plot, table, and about. 
One of the purpose of this is to prevent the app to be overcrowded by plots and table.
The contents of the app are divided across these pages based on their functions.
One page is dedicated to interactive plots as graphs allows users to easily identify
patterns and trends of a dataset. If the users wish to explore the data in greater
details, they can use the interactive table provided in the table page.

The plots provided in the app are related to arguably two of the most important 
metrics/statistics in COVID-19 data: cumulative and new daily cases. In addition,
the color scales used for the spatial map are easier to read by people with colorblindness.
The app also provides users with an appropriate degree of control in interacting with both
plots and tables.

### Rooms for Improvement

One of the limitations that the app has is the processing time it takes to respond to user input
(this only applies to plots). Furthermore, while the app itself is self-explanatory, a quick 
introduction about what each page tries to accomplish is a nice addition to add. Another limitation
of the app is that it often crashes when the users do not click the correct area of the map (the map
will only respond if the users click the name/abbreviation of the states.
